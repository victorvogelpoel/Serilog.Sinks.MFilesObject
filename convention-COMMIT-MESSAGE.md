# Dramatic commit messages

Inspired by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) and Angular Contributing guidelines.

```(generic)
<type>[optional scope>]: <description> [Optional trackID]
<BLANK LINE>
[optional body>]
<BLANK LINE>
[optional footer(s)]

```

The header is mandatory and is prefixed by a **type** and **scope**; the scope of the header is optional.
Note that the subject and body is separated by a BLANK LINE.
The footer should contain a closing reference to an issue if any.

**Rules** for the commit message

- Add type and optional scope and trackid to the subject line
- Limit the subject line to at most 72 characters
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Wrap the body text at 72 characters

See "Subject" below for rules about what the subject line should contain.

## Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change, along with a type/scope prefix and trackid postfix.

Every good commit should be able to complete the following sentence:

```(generic)
  If applied, this commit will: {{YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE}}
```

Rules for the description of the subject line:

- Prefix the description with a type and optional scope of the change
- use the imperative, present tense in the subject message: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- Do NOT capitalize the subject line
- Do NOT end the subject line with a period
- short message, at most 72 characters, including type and scope prefix (GitHub shows subject lines with more than 72 characters truncated)

Good description, for example (omitted type/scope for brevity)

- If applied, this commit will refactor subsystem X for readability
- If applied, this commit will update getting started documentation
- If applied, this commit will remove deprecated methods
- If applied, this commit will release version 1.0.0
- If applied, this commit will merge pull request #123 from user/branch

Notice how this DOESN'T WORK for the other non-imperative forms:

- If applied, this commit will fixed bug with Y
- If applied, this commit will changing behavior of X
- If applied, this commit will more fixes for broken stuff
- If applied, this commit will sweet new API methods

Remember: Use of the imperative is important only in the description of the subject line. You can relax this restriction when you're writing the body.

Prefix the commit message with a **type** and **(optional) scope**, and postfix the message with an issue track ID. See **Type** and **Scope** below for the supported words.

Example subject lines with type and scope:

- refactor(website): refactor subsystem website model for readability
- docs(api): change wording

## Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with **revert:** , followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say:
This reverts commit <hash>., where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

## Type

- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to the CI configuration files and scripts
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files; no production code change
- **docs**: documentation-only changes
- **resource**: resource changes; no production code change
- **feat**: new feature for the user (not a new feature for build script)
- **fix**: bug fix for the user (not a fix to a build script)
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc); no production code change
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests; no production code change

## Scope

The scope should be the name of the subsystem affected (as perceived by the person reading the changelog generated from commit messages.
The following is the list of supported scopes for Serilog.Sinks.MFilesObject:

- **common**: common things
- **config** - Configuration
- **sampleapp**: sample vault appl and sample console
- **vault**: sample vault 
- **logtovault**: writing log objects and logging vault structure
- **sink**: serilog log to M-Files sink

Other scopes
- **changelog**: used for updating the release notes in CHANGELOG.md
- **none/empty string**: useful for style, test and refactor changes that are done across all packages (e.g. style: add missing semicolons)

## TrackID

TrackID is the ID of the issue that is being addressed in this commit. For GitHub issues for example, it is the number of the issue: "#<number>".

## Body

Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes". The body should include the **motivation** for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

A good commit message should answer three questions about a patch:

- **Why is the change being made?** It may fix a bug, it may add a feature, it may improve performance, reliabilty, stability, or just be a change for the sake of correctness.
- **How does it address the issue?** For short obvious patches this part can be omitted, but it should be a high level description of what the approach was.
- **What effects does the patch have?** (In addition to the obvious ones, this may include benchmarks, side effects, etc.)
- Do not assume the reviewer understands what the original problem was.
- Do not assume the code is self-evident/self-documenting.
- Read the commit message to see if it hints at improved code structure.
- The first commit line is the most important.
- Describe any limitations of the current code.
- Do not include patch set-specific comments.

## Footer

The footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.
Breaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

This is where you can put useful meta-data regarding your commit, such as JIRA ticket numbers, GitHub issue numbers, co-author names, and additional links.
This can help to link important information together that relates to your change.

# Sample prefixes:

- build(deps):                 -> update library dependencies (nugets etc) - no other changes to production code
- feat(logtovault)             -> add or updating a user feature
- feat
- docs
- style: remove trailing whitespace
- resource
- test(logtovault)
