v1.0.0. First release!

`Serilog.Sinks.MFilesObject` is a Serilog structured logging sink to emit event messages to a "rolling" Log object or Log file in an M-Files vault.
*"M-Files is the intelligent document management system. With M-Files, organizations organize all their documents and information so that they can easily find, manage and secure them. M-Files is the smartest DMS youâ€™ve ever seen."*
Use Serilog structured logging in your M-Files console, integration and vault application solutions and see the logging appear as an object in the vault. Just open the M-Files desktop app and inspect the logging of your application.

This release features two sinks:

* MFilesLogObjectMessageSink: Log to a M-Files Log object with a multi-line text property.
* MFilesLogFileSink: Log to an M-Files Log File.

Both sinks work with batching, where new log messages are appended every 10 seconds, to prevent overly stress on the vault.
The log object is 'rolling': the sinks creates a new Log object in the vault for the current day, eg "Log 2021-09-22". When the multi-line text property reaches its limit of 10000 characters, the sink creates a new Log object for today with an ordinal between braces, eg "Log 2021-09-15 (2)".
The log file is 'rolling' as well, where the sink creates a Log text file document for the current day, eg eg "Log 2021-09-22.txt".
